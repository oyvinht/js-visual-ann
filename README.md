# js-visual-ann

A library for displaying an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

The library is developed for illustration/learning purposes.

A simple recurrent ANN simulator is included, using the logistics function for neuron activation. A feed-forward and maybe a CTRNN simulator might be added later.
