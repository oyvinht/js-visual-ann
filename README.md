# js-visual-ann

A library for displaying an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

The library is developed for illustration/learning purposes.

A simple recurrent ANN simulator is included, using the logistics function for neuron activation. A feed-forward and maybe a CTRNN simulator might be added later. 

**Example**

A simple example page is included.

A test page is available [here](http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~oyvinht/content/ann/).
